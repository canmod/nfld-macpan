This modelling was done in collaboration with Steve Walker, and fits a [compartmental epidemic model](https://mcmasterpandemic.shinyapps.io/mcmasterpandemicshiny/) to Newfoundland and Labrador COVID-19 data. This approach is used to model COVID-19 in [Ontario](https://mac-theobio.github.io/forecasts/outputs/McMasterOntarioForecastsBlog2022-01-26), however, there are differences in the model formulation for Newfoundland and Labrador. The software we used can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/mac-theobio/McMasterPandemic).
